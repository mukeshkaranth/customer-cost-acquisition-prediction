Below are the list of instructions on how to run the model.



README for Boosting Ensemble Method XGBoost -  mkara022@ucr.edu:
----------------------------------------------

Jupyter Notebook name: CS235_DMT_Final_Project_XGBoost_Mukesh.ipynb

1) Install the modules and dependencies and run:
"pip install -r requirements_xgboost.txt" 

2) Dataset will be attached along with source code.
If not, it can be found on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/medias-cost-prediction-in-foodmart
Else:
	If the file name is named: "media prediction and its cost.csv" go to step 3)
	else change the filename to "media prediction and its cost.csv"

3) In the "Importing Dataset" section, change the pd.read_csv() path to the path location of whereever you download the dataset.	

4) Now, Run all the cells in the CS235_DMT_Final_Project_XGBoost_Mukesh.ipynb file.

5) After successful running of the notebook, the results will be displayed on the notebook itself. 

Note: For any reason, if the code doesnt run please look at my google colab file, it has my executed results.
